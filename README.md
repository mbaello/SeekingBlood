# SeekingBlood

**What is Seeking Blood?**

Seeking Blood was a test to see how unique gameplay mechanics combined with a minimalist UI cooperated. Much of this project involved "reinventing the wheel," so to speak. Due to this complication, only some of the planned systems made it into the game, such as:
  * Platforming
  * Combat (Primitive Hitboxes)
  * Resources (i.e. Health, Stamina, and Reserve)
